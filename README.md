Project Name: Affordable London Housing Initiative

General Description:
London faces a severe affordable housing crisis, exacerbated by rising property prices, population growth, and limited availability. This project seeks to tackle the issue head-on by partnering with local authorities, developers, community groups, and residents to create innovative and inclusive housing solutions for low-income families, first-time buyers, and individuals struggling to afford skyrocketing rents.

Our mission is twofold: i) to increase the quantity of affordable homes available in the city and ii) to enhance the overall livability and accessibility of existing residential communities. Strategic priorities include advocacy for policy changes to incentivize private investors, implementation of green construction methods to minimize environmental footprints, and establishment of programs supporting social mobility for tenants via education, job training, and entrepreneurship.

Ultimately, the Affordable London Housing Initiative envisions a vibrant, equitable city where everyone has safe, secure, and accessible housing options, regardless of income level or socioeconomic status. By pooling diverse perspectives, sharing best practices, and mobilizing collective impact, we hope to reverse the tide of unaffordability and lay a lasting foundation for generations to come.

Investigated the correlation between economic indicators and average house prices in London boroughs, finding a positive association between financial prosperity and property values. Larger boroughs exhibited a stronger tendency for property transactions. When comparing predictive models, Random Forest emerged as the highest performer for regression (58.1%) and classification (74.6%). These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the London housing market, helping stakeholders make informed decisions regarding investments, policies, and resource allocation. Future directions involve exploring additional variables, refining model architectures, and updating data to capture shifts in market dynamics.
